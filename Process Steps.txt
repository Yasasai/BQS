1️⃣ Is Your Current Approach “Wrong”?

No. It’s NOT wrong for first-time ingestion.
In fact:

✔ Offset + limit pagination
✔ StatusCode filter
✔ Sequential persistence
✔ Logging every batch

This is exactly how most teams do Day-1 ingestion.

So you are not making a mistake.

First time Process to ingest data from Oracle CRM to PostgreSQL via API Call (crmrestAPI)

Downsides of your current approach:

Offset pagination becomes slower at higher offsets
One-by-one inserts = heavy DB overhead
Re-fetching everything every run = wasteful
No change-detection strategy
