# ✅ Sidebar Updated

## 🔧 User Issue
"not visible on role sidebar"

## 🛠️ Fix Implemented
I have updated the **RoleSidebar** to explicitly include a **Management** section.

**New Sidebar Structure:**
1.  **MANAGEMENT**
    *   **Executive Dashboard** (Links to the new Management Dashboard with all filters)
2.  **PRACTICE HEAD**
    *   Unassigned Opportunities
    *   ...
3.  **SOLUTION ARCHITECT**
    *   ...

## 🚀 How to Verify
1.  **Refresh your browser**.
2.  Open the Sidebar (Hamburger menu).
3.  You should now see the **Management** section at the top.
4.  Click **Executive Dashboard** to view the updated dashboard with **Completed**, **Accepted**, and **Rejected** tabs.
