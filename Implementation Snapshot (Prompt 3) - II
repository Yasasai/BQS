### Technical Notes

*   **Dynamic Dashboards**: The `ManagementDashboard`, `PracticeHeadDashboard`, `SalesHeadDashboard`, and `SolutionArchitectDashboard` components use a unified `OpportunitiesTable` to display data, with role-based logic and tab-based filtering.
*   **Workflow Integration**: Routing is tightly coupled with the `workflow_status` and `role` of the logged-in user, ensuring users only see relevant actions (e.g., GH/PH/SH see "Approve/Reject" while SA/SP see "Start/Continue Assessment").
*   **Stubs/Unused Pages**:
    *   `LeadershipDashboard.tsx`: Present in the codebase but NOT routed. Contains mock data. (Status: Stub)
    *   `PracticeHeadReview.tsx`: Present in the codebase but NOT routed. Contains mock data and legacy logic. (Status: Stub)
    *   `LeadershipDashboard.tsx`: Present in the codebase but NOT routed. (Status: Stub)
