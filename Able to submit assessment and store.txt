1. Able to submit assessment and store the scores with selected reasons 
2. Able to see all my logs as previous versions, I have an option to see my previous version scoring with attachments and justification also in my frontend itself


-- now I want to check if I am able to upload the PDFs and store it on my PC - or change according to storage tomorrow
Then I want to correct my front-end to make sure that submitted assessments are at one place and un-submitted are at another place
Then I want to make sure that all the front-end is as per what I am showing to the user - user-friendly
