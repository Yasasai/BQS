🔄 Restart Backend:
Stop the current backend (in the terminal where it's running):

Press Ctrl + C
Start it again:

cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Watch for this message:
🚀 BQS Starting...
✅ BQS Ready!
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
It should start much faster now (within 2-3 seconds).

Test the docs page again:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
It should open instantly now.

Test the API:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/opportunities
Should return JSON data immediately.

📝 What I Did:
I disabled the Oracle CRM sync on startup because it was:

Taking too long (probably trying to fetch from Oracle)
Blocking the entire backend from starting
Making every request timeout
Your data is still in PostgreSQL - we just disabled the automatic sync. You can manually sync later if needed using:

POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/sync-force
Try restarting the backend now and let me know if it starts faster!
